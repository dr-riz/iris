Iris Plants Database

Analysing Iris Plants dataset with Python

I collected and annotated the python code at Dr. Brownlee's blog post [1] in a python script (iris.py). The idea is to see the development process, which later might feed into a template. 

His work [2] is a very useful contribution to ML education and practise.
